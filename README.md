# User Story
Busy Employee wants a daily planner to add important events to, and manage time effectively.

## Requirements
- Current Day is displayed at the top of the calendar when the planner is opened. 
- Scrolling down reveals time blocks for standard buisness hours
- Each block is color-coded to indcate whether it is in the past, present or future
- Clicking into a time block allows you to enter a new event. (Think Google Calendar)
- Clicking on save button for that time block saves the text for that even in local storage.
- Saved events persist upon page refresh.
